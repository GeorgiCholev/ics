This is an image classification service built utilising Imagga tag generation.

It consists of two main modules.
A back-end built with Spring Boot and Gradle and front-end with Angular.
I tested them respectively with Rest Assured and Playwright.
I built it as a learning experience with the mentioned technologies and CI/CD with Github Actions and Docker.
